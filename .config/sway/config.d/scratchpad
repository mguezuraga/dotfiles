# Scratchpad:

# Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
# You can send windows there and get them back later.

# Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

# if you want to "remove it from scratchpad", you can simple make it tiling again (floating toggle).
# (with $mod+Shift+space, because it's condifured before as 'floating toggle')

# Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
# If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
